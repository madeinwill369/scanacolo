## How SCANA Workflows Are Engineered

SCANA's automation and AI execution workflows are built using a highly modular, visual logic system hosted on our internal platform. The structure is designed for flexibility, scale, and rapid iteration.

### 1. Modular, Visual Logic Engine

All workflows are developed inside our private node-based automation platform — similar to a visual programming interface — which allows us to:
- Chain conditional logic, filters, triggers, and actions
- Connect APIs, AI agents, and decision engines seamlessly
- Version, clone, and evolve workflows without breaking live deployments

This visual engine lets us prototype, test, and deploy intelligent trading and messaging flows in real time.

---

### 2. Cloud-Native Workflow Infrastructure

Our workflow engine is fully cloud-based, enabling:
- Real-time syncing and updates across environments
- Backend execution of AI-driven logic and signal processing
- Secure, isolated environments for user-specific workflows

This separation between logic layer and UI makes it easy to scale across users, strategies, or markets without rewriting core logic.

---

### 3. Front-End Integration (via Vercel)

The front-end for SCANA — including dashboard, user onboarding, and agent configuration — is deployed on Vercel. It connects to the workflow engine through secure API endpoints and includes:
- Dynamic asset rendering
- User input capture and agent configuration
- Visual status of workflow activity and performance

This makes SCANA feel seamless from the user's point of view, while preserving a strong backend/frontend separation for system reliability.

---

### 4. GitHub Sync (In Progress)

While our infrastructure is already functional and deployed, we're in the process of:
- Syncing all front-end and workflow configuration assets to a GitHub repository
- Standardizing deployment pipelines for collaborative development
- Enabling contributors to trace logic across both front and back ends

This ensures that SCANA can evolve as an open, extensible AI trading framework in future iterations.

## Summary

**SCANA doesn't just "run scripts."**

It operates as a modular AI agent system where workflows are treated as living, programmable entities — visual, editable, and cloud-native.
