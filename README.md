## How SCANA Workflows Are Engineered

SCANA's automation and AI execution workflows are built using a highly modular, visual logic system hosted on our internal platform. The structure is designed for flexibility, scale, and rapid iteration.

### 1. Modular, Visual Logic Engine

All workflows are developed inside our private node-based automation platform — similar to a visual programming interface — which allows us to:
- Chain conditional logic, filters, triggers, and actions
- Connect APIs, AI agents, and decision engines seamlessly
- Version, clone, and evolve workflows without breaking live deployments

This visual engine lets us prototype, test, and deploy intelligent trading and messaging flows in real time.

---

### 2. Cloud-Native Workflow Infrastructure

Our workflow engine is fully cloud-based, enabling:
- Real-time syncing and updates across environments
- Backend execution of AI-driven logic and signal processing
- Secure, isolated environments for user-specific workflows

This separation between logic layer and UI makes it easy to scale across users, strategies, or markets without rewriting core logic.

---

### 3. Front-End Integration (via Vercel)

The front-end for SCANA — including dashboard, user onboarding, and agent configuration — is deployed on Vercel. It connects to the workflow engine through secure API endpoints and includes:
- Dynamic asset rendering
- User input capture and agent configuration
- Visual status of workflow activity and performance

This makes SCANA feel seamless from the user's point of view, while preserving a strong backend/frontend separation for system reliability.

---

### 4. GitHub Sync (In Progress)

While our infrastructure is already functional and deployed, we're in the process of:
- Syncing all front-end and workflow configuration assets to a GitHub repository
- Standardizing deployment pipelines for collaborative development
- Enabling contributors to trace logic across both front and back ends

This ensures that SCANA can evolve as an open, extensible AI trading framework in future iterations.

---

## Summary

**SCANA doesn't just "run scripts."**

It operates as a modular AI agent system where workflows are treated as living, programmable entities — visual, editable, and cloud-native.

## The SCANA MasterNode: Real-Time AI Execution Engine

At the core of SCANA lies the MasterNode, a dynamic execution system designed to intelligently orchestrate every feature, query, and interaction across the platform.

It is not just a logic controller — it is a living, modular AI agent capable of adapting to user behavior, invoking workflows, and maintaining personalized trading experiences.

### Key Functions of the MasterNode

The MasterNode executes and coordinates the following feature sets in real time:

#### Token Discovery & Scanning
- `/explore`, `/trending`, `/verified`
- Pulls live blockchain data, filters by risk, novelty, and trend velocity

#### Security Auditing
- `/rug`, `/locked`
- Performs on-chain checks for potential rug pulls or liquidity lock status

#### Whale & Wallet Intelligence
- `/whales`, `/wallet`
- Tracks and surfaces significant wallet movements and user-specified wallets

#### Token Profiling
- `/token`
- Aggregates metadata, pricing, liquidity, holder stats, and sentiment signals

#### Live Trade Execution
- `/trade`
- Enables direct interaction with trading flows from inside the chat environment

#### Behavioral State Management
- Tracks last picks, wallet focus, and user interests using `/save`
- Customizes flow branches based on user history and interaction metadata

#### Gamification & Virality
- `/game`, `/affiliate`
- Injects community dynamics and incentives for user growth and retention

#### Pro Features & Flow Layering
- `/upgrade`, `/settings`, `/chat`
- Routes power users into more advanced, high-frequency agent workflows

---

### Architectural Design

The MasterNode is built on a visual, cloud-native flow system that allows us to:
- Dynamically chain together flows with logic gates, timers, conditions, and subflows
- React in real time to any command, signal, or system event
- Deploy updates across all user agents instantly without downtime

---

### Think of it like this:

SCANA's MasterNode is a composable AI brain that executes micro-strategies across DeFi using real-time data, personalized logic, and user intent — all within a chat-first environment.

It is what enables SCANA to behave like a living assistant — not just a dashboard or scanner.

## SCANA's Automated News Intelligence Workflow

One of the powerful systems inside SCANA is our AI-driven News Workflow, which autonomously scrapes, filters, analyzes, and routes relevant financial or crypto news to users based on their profiles.

### How It Works

This workflow is built using our internal visual flow engine, which allows us to map logic, conditions, and responses in a modular, real-time way. Here's how the system operates:

#### 1. Scraping External News Sources

SCANA initiates the workflow by scraping data from external platforms like X (Twitter) and other news feeds using custom triggers or APIs. This ensures:
- Real-time capture of relevant trends
- Coverage of fast-moving updates that could impact market behavior

---

#### 2. Conditional Filtering

Once news is ingested, the flow applies conditional filters to check:
- If the source is verified or high-priority
- Whether the news matches the user's tracked assets, preferences, or portfolio tags

Only high-relevance news is passed through.

---

#### 3. Intelligent Message Dispatch

Based on matched conditions, the system then:
- Sends a tailored message to the user (e.g., on Telegram, web chat, or email)
- Sets custom fields (for user segmentation or future targeting)
- Tracks engagement and user interaction

Messages are often enriched with call-to-actions, like:

> "This asset has moved before on similar news. Want to auto-trade?"

---

#### 4. Action-Condition Logic

The flow includes logic gates that:
- Trigger additional flows (e.g., price alerts, sentiment analysis)
- Wait for user interaction and adapt based on whether they engage
- Record user behavior and feed it into personalization metrics

---

#### 5. Chained Execution

After the initial interaction, the flow can:
- Trigger deeper analysis flows (like SCANA Pro sentiment scoring)
- Route the user into automated strategy suggestions
- Log all actions for audit and ML feedback loops

---

### Designed for Speed + Signal

This isn't just a notification tool — it's a real-time intelligence agent.

By combining external data, internal tagging, and AI personalization, the SCANA News Workflow acts like a digital analyst who never sleeps.
